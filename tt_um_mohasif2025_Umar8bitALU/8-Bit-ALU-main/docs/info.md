## How it works

8-Bit ALU with state machine to read A and B inputs using the 8 digital pins.
Operation control over the In/Out pins.
Status out over the In/Out pins.

## Overview
This project implements an **8-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** capable of performing operations on two 8-bit inputs (`A` and `B`).  
The design uses a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to control input reading, calculation, and result/status output.

## Supported Operations
The ALU supports the following 7 operations:

| Operations   |
|--------------|
| A |
| NOT A |
| A AND B |
| A OR B |
| A XOR B |
| A + B |
| A - B |

## Control Logic
Inputs are read sequentially using an FSM with dedicated states for reading operands and producing outputs.

### FSM States

| State  | S0 | S1 |
|-------|----|----|
| READ_A | 0 | 0 |
| READ_B | 0 | 1 |
| CALC   | 1 | 0 |
| STATUS | 1 | 1 |

- **READ_A** – reads the first operand `A`
- **READ_B** – reads the second operand `B`
- **CALC** – performs the selected ALU operation
- **STATUS** – outputs extended status information about the result

## Operation Control
Operations are selected using the **`f[4:0]` control inputs** from bidirectional pins.

| Operation | F0 | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 |
|-----------|----|----|----|----|----|
| A | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| NOT A | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| A AND B | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| A OR B | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| A XOR B | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| A + B | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| A - B | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

## ALU Status Flags

| Flag Name        | Binary Value | Description |
|------------------|-------------|-------------|
| DEFAULT_FLAG   | 00 | Default state, no special condition |
| ZERO_FLAG    | 01 | Result of the operation is zero |
| NEGATIVE_FLAG  | 10 | Result is negative |
| OVERFLOW_FLAG  | 11 | Arithmetic overflow occurred |

## Top-Level I/O
| Signal        | Dir | W | Description |
| --- | :---: | :---: | --- |
| `clk`           | in  | 1 | System clock |
| `rst_n`         | in  | 1 | Async reset (active-low) |
| `ena`           | in  | 1 | Always '1' on TinyTapeout |
| `ui_in[7:0]`    | in  | 8 | Inputs for reading A and B operators |
| `uo_out[7:0]`   | out | 8 | Outputs displaying result and status of ALU |
| `uio_in[7:3]`   | in  | 5 | F0-F4 Control Keys |
| `uio_in[2]`     | in  | 1 | Carry/Borrow Input |
| `uio_out[7:0]`  | out | 8 | *Unused* - set to '0' |
| `uio_oe[7:0]`   | out | 8 | set to '0' using uio as inputs |

## How to test

1. Set status READ_A or READ_B to read A and B operators
2. Set the operation using the f[] birectional inputs
3. Set status CALC, ALU peroforms operation and displays result
4. Set status STATUS do display ALU status flag and carry/borrow out
